    "## Use of auxiliary variables \n",
    "\n",
    "Slice sampling is a simple MCMC algorithm that introduces the idea of auxiliary variables. The motivation for slice sampling is that if we can sample uniformly from the region under the graph of the target distribution, we will have random samples from the target distribution. In the univariate case, the algorithm is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "- start with some $x$ where $p(x) \\ne 0$\n",
    "- repeat\n",
    "    - sample $y$ (auxiliary variable) uniformly from 0 to $f(x)$\n",
    "    - draw a horizontal line at $y$ within $p(x)$ (this may consist of multiple intervals)\n",
    "    - sample $x$ from the horizontal segments\n",
    "\n",
    "The auxiliary $y$ variable allows us to sample $(x, y)$ points that are in the region under the graph of the target distribution. Only the $x$ variable is used for the Monte Carlo samples - the $y$ variables are simply discarded. This works because the joint distribution is constructed so that it factors $p(x, y) = p(y \\mid x) p(x)$ and so projecting leaves just $p(x)$. The slice sampler is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method since the next $(x, y)$ position depends only on the current position. Like Gibbs sampling, there is no tuning process and all proposals are accepted. For slice sampling, you either need the inverse distribution function or some way to estimate it. Later we will see that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo also uses auxiliary variables to generate a new proposal in an analogous way.\n",

    "HMC uses an auxiliary variable corresponding to the momentum of particles in a potential energy well to generate proposal distributions that can make use of gradient information in the posterior distribution. For reversibility to be maintained, the total energy of the particle has to be conserved - hence we are interested in Hamiltonian systems. The main attraction of HMC is that it works much better than other methods when variables of interest are highly correlated. Because we have to solve problems involving momentum, we need to understand how to numerically solve differential equations in a way that is both accurate (i.e. second order) and preserves total energy (necessary for a Hamiltonian system).\n",

The bisection algorithm works in the following way - given the left and right boundary, it checks if the crossing is between left and mid-point, or between the right and mid-point. If the former, the mid-point is set as the new right boundary and so on. In other words the interval containing the crossing is halved at each step. Stop when the length of the interval is less than 1e-6, and return the left and right boundaries at that point.\n",
